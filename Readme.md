# Planners Visualisation

This repository contains a set of tools and scripts for visualizing path planning algorithms. The project aims to provide an easy-to-understand interface for exploring and comparing different planners like A*, RRT, and Dijkstra, HA among others.

## Features

- **Multiple Path Planning Algorithms:** Visualize different planning algorithms such as A*, RRT, and Dijkstra.
- **Real-time Visualization:** Watch how planners explore the space and find paths.
- **Customizable Environments:** Define custom grid-based maps for testing planners.
- **Performance Metrics:** Compare algorithms based on execution time, path length, and number of nodes explored.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **Python version**: 3.12.2
- Install required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pygame==2.5.0 pygame_gui==0.6.0
    ```

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nsk-05/planners_visualisation.git
   cd planners_visualisation
   ```
2. Run visualization
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```
